The paradox of \"everything is and isn\\'t, at the same time\": This paradox reflects the idea that reality can be complex and contradictory. It suggests that things can possess multiple aspects or attributes that appear contradictory but are simultaneously true. Quantum physics, for example, explores the concept of particles existing in multiple states simultaneously.\\n\\n5. The paradox of \"all truths are but half-truths\": This paradox suggests that even truths or knowledge that seem complete or absolute may actually be partial or incomplete. It acknowledges the limitations of human understanding and the constant potential for new information or perspectives to emerge.\\n\\nThese examples illustrate the contradictions and paradoxes that can arise when trying to comprehend complex and multifaceted aspects of existence.')]\n"

Furthermore, it is said that \"THE ALL\" withdraws its attention from the universe at the end of countless cycles of time, and the spirit of each soul is not annihilated but infinitely expanded, merging the created with the creator.\n",
